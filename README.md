# Vue + tailwind + webpack boilerplate

This boilerplate provides the a simple setup needed to create development and production environments for Vue 3 apps using Tailwind and FontAwesome, building them afterwards into production with Webpack. Everything is explained step by step, to better understand what is going on, so it is easy to use this as the base to start building your own apps. Every step of the setup is fully explained and documented.

## Quickstart

To get started simply install the project using `npm install` and use the following commands:

- `npm run serve:dev` to serve the project locally using the development build
- `npm run serve:prod` to serve the project locally using the production build
- `npm run build:dev` to build the project in development mode, the output will be saved in üìÇdist. Good to test the development build files generated or to work using an extension like [live server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
- `npm run build:prod` to build the project in production mode, the output will be saved in üìÇdist. Run this command before putting the application live.



## Folder structure

```shell
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÇdist                    # Distribution folder, contains your latest build

```

## Installing vue

The first thing is to [install Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html) running the following command:

```shell
npm install vue
``` 

> üìù **_NOTE:_**  If Vue 3 is not yet the main release use the command `npm install vue@latest`

## Installing webpack

Next thing is to install webpack. From now on all dependencies are used only during development so they will all include the `-D` flag.

```shell
npm install -D webpack webpack-cli
```

- **webpack:** This installs the webpack main functionalities
- **webpack-cli:** Since webpack version 4, the command line interface (CLI) got removed from the main package and added to its own repo and package. If you want to access the `webpack` command install this too. These two first dependencies make up for the most basic local webpack installation ([docs](https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/))

> üìù **_NOTE:_**  The CLI is linked inside the `node_modules/.bin` folder. This means that you won't be able to use `webpack` normally through the console but your scripts inside `package.json` will access it without issue.

> üìù **_NOTE:_** You can still access the `webpack` commands using the `npx` command shipped with Node 8.2/npm 5.2.0. You can try to run `npx webpack --version` to check if the command works and see the installed dependencies versions.

## Installing Vue-loader

Vue loader is a [webpack loader](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/loaders/) that allows us to process Single-File Components (SFC). ([docs](https://vue-loader.vuejs.org/guide/#manual-setup))

```shell
npm install -D vue-loader vue-template-compiler style-loader css-loader 
```

- **vue-loader:** This installs the main vue-loader functionalities
- **vue-template-compiler:** The vue-template-compiler has two primary functions: converting templates to render() functions and parsing single file componens.
- **style-loader:** Adds CSS to the DOM by injecting a \<style\> tag ([docs](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/style-loader))
- **css-loader:** Gives you more control over importing .css files. ([docs](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/css-loader/))

> üìù **_NOTE:_** On the docs it is mentioned to use the `vue-style-loader` but this loader is not well maintained. Instead we will use the `style-loader` provided by webpack.

> üìù **_NOTE:_** We need to import `css-loader` since it is not a dependency of `vue-loader` anymore.

### Related webpack configuration

```js
const VueLoaderPlugin = require('vue-loader/lib/plugin')

module.exports = {

    module: {
        rules: [{
                test: /\.vue$/,
                loader: 'vue-loader'
            },
            {
                test: /\.css$/,
                use: [
                    'style-loader',
                    //other css loaders
                ]
            },
            //other rules
        ]
    },
    plugins: [
        new VueLoaderPlugin(),
        //other plugins
    ]
    ...
}
```

## Installing html-webpack-plugin

This plugin will create and dynamically inject the dependencies of our application into the main HTML file. ([docs](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/html-webpack-plugin/))

```shell
npm install --save-dev html-webpack-plugin
```

Since the HTML file created needs to have a `\<div id="app"\>` tag to load our Vue components in, we will be using a template located in `public/index.html`.

### Related webpack configuration

```js
const path = require('path')

module.exports = {
    plugins: [
        new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
            template: path.resolve(__dirname, 'public/index.html')
        }),
        //other plugins
    ],
}
```

## Installing tailwind

Now we will install the `tailwindCSS` library for our CSS styling on the page ([docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation))

```shell
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer postcss-import postcss-loader
```

- **tailwindcss:** Installs the main tailwind functionalities
- **postcss:** A tool for transforming styles with JS plugins. These plugins can lint your CSS, support variables and mixins, transpile future CSS syntax, inline images, and more ([docs](https://github.com/postcss/postcss))
- **postcss-loader:** A webpack loader to process CSS with PostCSS ([docs](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/postcss-loader/))
- **autoprefixer:** Parses CSS files adding vendor prefixes to CSS rules so you can forget and write normal CSS ([docs](https://css-tricks.com/autoprefixer/))
- **postcss-import:** Offers the ability to organize your CSS into multiple files and combine them at build time by processing @import statements in advance ([docs](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-import))

### Related webpack configuration

Aside from the `webpack.config.js` file, we will create the postcss configuration inside the `postcss.config.js` file. The first thing is to call this loader from our webpack file:

`webpack.config.js`
```js
const VueLoaderPlugin = require('vue-loader/lib/plugin')
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin')
const path = require('path')

module.exports = {
    module: {
        rules: [
            {
                test: /\.css$/,
                use: [{
                        loader: 'css-loader',
                        options: {
                            // 0 => no loaders (default);
                            // 1 => postcss-loader;
                            // 2 => postcss-loader, sass-loader
                            importLoaders: 1
                        }
                    },
                    //other loaders
                    'postcss-loader'
                ]
            },
            //other rules
        ]
    },

}
```

`postcss.config.js` calling the needed plugins to process the tailwindCSS files and loading the tailwind configuration.

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    require("postcss-import"),
    require("tailwindcss"),
    require("autoprefixer"),
  ],
};
```

### Configuring tailwind

In order to integrate tailwind there are additional steps to take, first of all we will initialize its configuration file:

```shell
npx tailwind init
```

This will create the `tailwind.config.js` file. Next we need to create a css file that includes all of the tailwind functionalities. This file is located under `src/css/tailwind.css` and simply contains the following imports:

```css
@import "tailwindcss/base";
@import "tailwindcss/components";
@import "tailwindcss/utilities";
```

Finally this needs to be imported from our `main.js` file, in this case using the line `import './css/tailwind.css';`

> üìù **_NOTE:_** PurgeCSS is not needed with Tailwind 3 since it uses a new engine that generates only the styles you need. ([docs](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/7203))

## Setting up a webpack dev server

To test our builds we will set up a simple server used to test our project locally ([docs](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/))

```shell
npm install -D webpack-dev-server
```

### Related webpack configuration

In order to use the development server, we first need to configure a few fields:

- **entry:** This defines the entry point for our webpack process ([docs](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/entry-points/#single-entry-shorthand-syntax))
- **devtool:** This option if and how source maps are generated ([docs](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/devtool/)). They are useful for debugging once a bug is reproduced in a production environment, but will slow down build times.
- **devServer:** The devServer configuration
  - **open:** Tells dev-server to open the browser after server had been started.
  - **devMiddleware:** Provide options to webpack-dev-middleware which handles webpack assets.
    - **writeToDisk:** Tells devServer to write generated assets to the disk.
  - **static:** This option allows configuring options for serving static files from the directory
    - **watch:** When enabled, it will look for changes on the `entry` file and its dependencies and will trigger a full page reload if it finds any


```js
const path = require('path')

module.exports = {
    entry: path.join(__dirname, 'src/main.js'),
    devServer: {
        open: true,
        devMiddleware: {
            writeToDisk: true,
        },
        static: {
            watch: true,
        },
    },
}
```

## Setting up MiniCssExtractPlugin

This plugin extracts all our styles into separate `.css` files, one for each `.js` file in our application. In our case this will only generate a sinlge `.css` file from our `main.js` file ([docs](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/mini-css-extract-plugin/)). To install we run:

```shell
npm install -D mini-css-extract-plugin
```

### Related webpack configuration

Once installed, we only need to configure it on our `webpack.config.js` file:

```js
const MiniCssExtractPlugin = require('mini-css-extract-plugin');

module.exports = {
    module: {
        rules: [
            //other rules
            {
                test: /\.css$/,
                use: [
                    // other loaders
                    {
                        loader: MiniCssExtractPlugin.loader,
                        options: {
                            esModule: false,
                        },
                    },

                ]
            },
        ]
    },
    plugins: [
        // other plugins
        new MiniCssExtractPlugin(),
    ],
  // other config
}
```

## Setting up CssMinimizerPlugin

Even though or styles files are not huge, we can cut them in half of what's left by just minifying their contents. To start first we need to install the dependency ([docs](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/css-minimizer-webpack-plugin/)):

```shell
npm install -D mini-css-extract-plugin
```

### Related webpack configuration

Following the docs above we only need to configure the CssMinimizerPlugin as an additional optimization step:

```js
const CssMinimizerPlugin = require('css-minimizer-webpack-plugin');

module.exports = {
    // other config
    optimization: {
        minimizer: [
          // For webpack@5 you can use the `...` syntax to extend existing minimizers
          '...',
          new CssMinimizerPlugin(),
        ],
      },
}
```

Since webpack version >4, the optimizations are set automatically for you, but they can be extended this way. Webpack includes `webpack-terser-plugin` by default in order to minify the `.js` files too. For this reason we want to make sure to uncomment the `'...'` part so the rest of the optimization steps provided by webpack are left as is. The configuration above would be *similar* to the following (*note that webpack takes more optimization steps in addition to minifying the `.js` files*):

```js
// This serves just as an example, webpack provides more optimization steps when using '...'
const CssMinimizerPlugin = require('css-minimizer-webpack-plugin');
const TerserPlugin = require("terser-webpack-plugin");

module.exports = {
    // other config
    optimization: {
        minimizer: [
          // For webpack@5 you can use the `...` syntax to extend existing minimizers (i.e. `terser-webpack-plugin`), uncomment the next line
          new TerserPlugin(),
          new CssMinimizerPlugin(),
        ],
      },
}
```

> üìù **_NOTE:_** In the docs you can see the `minimize: true` option. This is also set depending on whether you are running in development or productio mode. In this project, the mode is defined through the `--mode` flag on the `package.json` commands and there is no need to include the `minimize` option.

## Setting up FontAwesome for our icons

We will add a few icons to our interface too. To do so the choice is `fontawesome` since it has a nice support for Tree Shaking ([docs](https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/javascript-api/other/tree-shaking)) as well as a package for vue specifically called `vue-fontawesome`. To get started:

```
npm install -D @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core @fortawesome/vue-fontawesome@latest @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons @fortawesome/free-regular-svg-icons
``` 

- **@fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core:** This contains the core javascript api ([docs](https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/javascript-api/setup/getting-started))
- **@fortawesome/vue-fontawesome@latest:** Has the component we will use on our Vue application to render the icons ([docs](https://github.com/FortAwesome/vue-fontawesome#introduction))
- **@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons:** The package of solid icons of fontawesome
- **@fortawesome/free-regular-svg-icons:** The package of regular icons of fontawesome

> üìù **_NOTE:_** In this case we will work with the *free* icons of font awesome, you can find how to import the solid, regular, brand or **pro** icons on the `"add more styles or pro icons"` section in the [docs](https://github.com/FortAwesome/vue-fontawesome#add-more-styles-or-pro-icons)

> üìù **_NOTE:_** If the default fontawesome import is still for versions 2.x of vue, use `npm i -D @fortawesome/vue-fontawesome@prerelease`

### Configuring font awesome

We want to import the needed icons on each component instead of importing them all globally. To do so we will add the following lines on our `main.js` file to import the dependency and register the component:

```js
...
import { FontAwesomeIcon } from '@fortawesome/vue-fontawesome'
...

const app = createApp(App)
  .component("font-awesome-icon", FontAwesomeIcon)
  .mount("#app");
```

Once the library is imported and the component registered, whenever we want to use an icon first we will import the icon, the library and then add the icon to the library and finally use them in our template, for example:

```js
<script>
import { faAddressBook } from "@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons";
import { library } from "@fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core";

export default {
  beforeCreate() {
    library.add(faAddressBook);
  },
};
</script>
```

```html
<template>
  <font-awesome-icon :icon="['fas', 'address-book']" />
</template>
```

> üìù **_NOTE:_**  I recommend going through the [docs](https://github.com/FortAwesome/vue-fontawesome#the-icon-property) if you've never used font awesome before and you can also search for icons [here](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&p=2).

> üìù **_NOTE:_** There are two things to look our for when using fontAwesome. The first thins is that, while the import name is in `camelCase`, the element itself will use `kebab-case`. The second thing is that you need to make sure that you are using the right prefix (fas for solid, far for regular and fab for brands).

## Setting up dark mode with Tailwind.css

Dark mode support comes built-in with `Tailwind.css` making things much easier to set up ([docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode)). This mode is disabled by default in order to keep the size at a minimum and needs to be enabled on the `tailwind.config.js` file by setting the `darkMode` option:

`tailwind.config.js`
```js
module.exports = {
  content: [
    './src/**/*.html',
    './src/**/*.vue',
    './src/*.js',
    './src/*.vue',
  ],
  darkMode: 'class', // or 'media' or false
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  variants: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

Since we want to toggle the dark mode manually through the use of a class we will set the `darkMode` option to `class`. Then on our root element we will set that class dynamically when the user clicks on the moon icon at the bottom-left corner:

`src/App.vue`
```xml
<template>
  <div :class="{ dark: isDarkModeActive }">
    <div class="flex flex-row h-screen antialiased text-gray-800">
      <Sidebar @toggle-dark-mode="isDarkModeActive = !isDarkModeActive" />
      <Chat />
    </div>
  </div>
</template>
```

Using this approach, we will receive an event from the `Sidebar.vue` component (where the moon button is) that will toggle the `isDarkModeActive` variable to activate the `dark` class conditionally, applying the styles on all the page accordingly.

## Troubleshooting
